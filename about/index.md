Hi! My name is Jason Swope. I am a computer science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am from Norcross Georgia and just finished an internship with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There I built a private cloud environment to be used by the Mars2020 project for data analysis utilizing tools such as Docker and Jenkins. I also created instructional videos on data analysis tools such as Papermill and nbconvert.

At the beginning of this year I studied abroad In Sydney Australia at the University of New South Whales (UNSW). There I was able to explore Australia and New Zealand while taking courses on artificial intelligence and algorithm design.

In my internship in the summer of 2018 I worked for Amazon on the internal accounts team for Amazon Web Services and created a chat bot to assist Amazon staff with managing internal accounts. More specifically I created a text preprocessing framework that formatted the intents for the bot utilizing regex and integrated account specific functionality such as finding additional account information. Also, I created automated tests for internal software packages using Mockito and JUnit and achieved 82% coverage for the targeted package.

In addition to my internship, I also participated in an Amazon Hackathon over the summer. I created an Alexa skill to help the nonprofit Code.org. The skill located the closest school that teaches computer science around a given zip code and filtered based on parameters such as grade level, coding language, and cost.
  
I have also conducted reseaerch at Georgia Tech's Computational Perception Laboratory where I am working on utilizing computer vision to diagnose children with autism based on video. We have recently finished extracting the body points and are now working on identifying when a child is perfomring certain actions. My role is to use a neural network to determine when a child is pointing.

My best language is java and am also very fluent with Pyton. I am familiar with C, assembly, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Prolog, and MATLAB as well. I have experience working with computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning.
