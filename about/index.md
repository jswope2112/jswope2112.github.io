Hi! I am Jason, a computer scientists at Georgia Tech. I am from Norcross Georgia and atteneded Norcross high school. Currently in my second year here, I am involved with research under Jim Rehg studying human-computer interactions.

I am most skilled in java, but am also fluent in python, matlab, html and css. I have experience working with APIs, as shown in my project, and am learning about machine learning within my lab. 

My experience includes participating in the Grand Challenges Living Learning Community at Georgia Tech last year. Here I worked with a group of 5 other students to create a more efficient method to objectively diagnose concussions so that we can more accurately assess when they happen and get athletes the help they need. The resulting plan was to look into radar technology to measure the gait of people as they walk and use that data to infer whether or not they are impaired.

but thats all stuff I wrote, what I really want to say is

## Tina ##
I Love you
