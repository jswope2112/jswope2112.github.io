Hi! My name is Jason Swope. I am a computer science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am from Norcross Georgia and just finished an internship with Amazon. I worked on the internal accounts team for Amazon Web Services and created a chat bot to assist Amazon staff with managing internal accounts. More specifically I created a text preprocessing framework that formatted the intents for the bot utilizing regex and integrated account specific functionality such as finding additional account information. Also, I created automated tests for internal software packages using Mockito and JUnit and achieved 82% coverage for the targeted package.

In addition to my internship, I also participated in an Amazon Hackathon over the summer. I created an Alexa skill to help the nonprofit Code.org. The skill located the closest school that teaches computer science around a given zip code and filtered based on parameters such as grade level, coding language, and cost.
  
I am curently at Georgia Tech's Computational Perception Laboratory where I am working on utilizing computer vision to diagnose children with autism based on video. We have recently finished extracting the body points and are now working on identifying when a child is perfomring certain actions. My role is to use a neural network to determine when a child is pointing.

My best language is java, but I am also fluent in python, C, assembly, HTML, CSS, and MATLAB. I have experience working with computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning.
