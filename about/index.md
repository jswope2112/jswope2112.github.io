Hi! My name is Jason Swope. I am a computer science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am from Norcross Georgia and currently involved in research with Jim Rehg about human-computer interactions.
 
My best language is java, but I am also fluent in python, MATLAB, HTML and CSS. I have experience working with APIs, as shown in my project, and am learning about machine learning within my lab.
 
My experience includes participating in the Grand Challenges Living Learning Community at Georgia Tech last year. Here I worked with a group of 5 other students to create a more efficient method to objectively diagnose concussions so that we can more accurately assess when they happen and get athletes the help they need. The resulting plan was to look into radar technology to measure the gait of people as they walk and use that data to infer whether or not they are impaired.

I am curently at Georgia Tech's Computational Perception Laboratory where I am working on utilizing computer vision to diagnose children with autism based on video. My role is to automate the process of annotating the videos of the children so that we do not need to have staff go in and mark when the chilid holds the toy and does not.

In addition to classes I am involved with Outdoor Recreation at Georgia Tech. I am currently and instructor in training and am learning on how to lead backpacking expeditions with beginners.
