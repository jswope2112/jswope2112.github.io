Hi! My name is Jason Swope. I am a computer science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am from Norcross Georgia and currently involved in research with Jim Rehg about human-computer interactions.
 
My best language is java, but I am also fluent in python, matlab, html and css. I have experience working with APIs, as shown in my project, and am learning about machine learning within my lab.
 
My experience includes participating in the Grand Challenges Living Learning Community at Georgia Tech last year. Here I worked with a group of 5 other students to create a more efficient method to objectively diagnose concussions so that we can more accurately assess when they happen and get athletes the help they need. The resulting plan was to look into radar technology to measure the gait of people as they walk and use that data to infer whether or not they are impaired.
 
In addition to classes I am involved with Outdoor Recreation at Georgia Tech. I currently backpack, but plan on trying white water kayaking and climbing whenever I can.
